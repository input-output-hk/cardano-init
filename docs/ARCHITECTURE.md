# cardano-init: Architecture

**Status:** Draft · **Last updated:** 2026-06-01 · **Owner:** Robertino Martinez

> This is the **canonical** architecture document. It supersedes the legacy root-level `REQUIREMENTS.md` and `ARCHITECTURE.md` (now deleted; available in git history). Read [PRD.md](./PRD.md) for the *why* and *for whom*; this document owns the *how*. Detailed contracts, data shapes, and edge cases live in [TECH_SPEC.md](./TECH_SPEC.md); sequencing lives in [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md).

---

## 1. Design principles

Five principles drive every structural decision in the codebase. When a tradeoff arises, these are the tie-breakers.

1. **The interface contract is the core abstraction.** Every tool template conforms to a shared set of conventions (canonical blueprint path, standard Justfile tasks, standard `.env` variables). Because each template *independently* conforms, any producer composes with any consumer **without per-pair integration code**. Composition is generic over the *set of roles present*, never over *which tools fill them*. This is what makes the system scale as O(tools) rather than O(tools²).

2. **Tools are data-driven; roles are a fixed code vocabulary.** Tools and templates are declarative data embedded at compile time: adding a *tool* is a data change (a TOML file + a template directory + a recompile), never a change to CLI logic. **Roles**, by contrast, are a small fixed vocabulary defined in code (the `Role` enum, §3.1): the registry *references* roles but cannot introduce them. The set is not frozen at a particular number (it can grow) but growing it is a deliberate, rare code change, not a data change.

3. **Pure core, impure edges.** `registry/`, `scaffold/`, `contract`, and the pure part of `doctor/` are pure logic over data with **zero dependency on `cli/`**. All user interaction, terminal formatting, network, and system probing live at the edges (`cli/`, `web/`, the impure half of `doctor/`). This keeps the core testable and makes future extraction (e.g. WASM) straightforward.

4. **Deterministic generation.** Identical inputs produce byte-identical output. This is a hard requirement for coding-agent trust, reproducibility, and snapshot tests. Determinism is guaranteed at the **planning** phase (§6.4).

5. **Offline and self-contained.** The registry and all templates are embedded in the binary; generation makes no network calls. Network is used only for installing toolchains (the doctor) and a best-effort version-update notice (§9). The binary, for a given version, is the single source of truth for what it generates.

---

## 2. Crate & module structure

A single Rust crate. The boundary between "library logic" and "CLI concerns" is enforced by the module dependency graph (§2.2), not by separate crates. Items marked **(planned)** are introduced by the PRD and not yet implemented.

Assets are embedded with **rust-embed** via `#[folder = "registry/"]` and `#[folder = "templates/"]`. There is **no `build.rs`**: embedding is handled by the derive macro directly. (The legacy architecture doc referenced a `build.rs` asset manifest; that is obsolete.)

### 2.2 Module dependency graph

The graph flows strictly downward; there are no cycles. The key invariant: **`registry`, `scaffold`, `contract`, and the pure part of `doctor` never depend on `cli` or `web`.**

```
main.rs
  │
  ├── cli/ ──────┬─▶ scaffold/ ─▶ registry/        web/ ─┬─▶ scaffold::planner
  │              ├─▶ doctor/   ─▶ registry/              └─▶ registry/
  │              ├─▶ registry/                           (web is an edge, like cli)
  │              └─▶ contract
  │
  scaffold/, doctor/(pure), registry/  ──▶  contract
```

`cli/` and `web/` are sibling **edges**: both orchestrate the pure core and present results. Neither is depended upon by the core.

---

## 3. Data model

All core types live in `registry/types.rs` (and `scaffold/` for pipeline-internal types). Exact field-level definitions and invariants are in TECH_SPEC; this is the shape and intent.

### 3.1 Roles

```rust
pub enum Role { OnChain, OffChain, Infrastructure, Testing, FormalMethods }
```

- `Role::ALL` defines the **canonical order** used for deterministic output.
- Each role maps to a kebab string (`on-chain`, `formal-methods`, …) for TOML/flags, a `Display` name for humans, and a contract directory (`dir()` → §4).
- **The enum is the sole source of truth for the role vocabulary: roles are *not* defined by the repository data.** A tool's `[roles.<kebab>]` blocks merely *reference* existing roles; the registry cannot introduce a new one. Role strings are validated against the enum at load time via `Role::from_kebab` (an unknown role → `RegistryError::UnknownRole`). What the registry data determines is which *tools* exist and which of these fixed roles each can fill, not the set of roles itself.
- Adding a role is therefore a deliberate code change touching every site that names roles: a new `Role` variant + `Role::ALL` + `from_kebab`/`as_kebab`/`dir()`/`Display`, a `contract::DIR_*` constant, `TemplateContext` handling, a CLI flag, and the web query params. Adding a *tool*, by contrast, is pure data. The role set is small and grows rarely.

### 3.2 Tools

```rust
pub struct ToolDef {
    pub id, name, description, website: String,
    pub languages: Vec<String>,
    pub nix_packages: Vec<String>,         // toolchains for the Nix dev shell
    pub roles: HashMap<Role, RoleConfig>,  // which roles this tool can fill
}
pub struct RoleConfig { pub template: String }  // path under templates/
```

`system_deps` is declared in the tool TOML and consumed by the **doctor** (§8). One tool can fill multiple roles (e.g. Scalus: on-chain + off-chain + testing), each with its own template path.

### 3.3 Selection (the resolved user choice)

```rust
pub struct Selection {
    pub project_name: String,
    pub assignments: Vec<RoleAssignment>,  // Infrastructure may appear multiple times
    pub network: Network,                  // Preview | Preprod | Mainnet (default Preview)
    pub nix: bool,
}
pub struct RoleAssignment { pub role: Role, pub tool_id: String }
```

**Constraint enforcement is by construction.** Role uniqueness (one tool per role, except Infrastructure) is enforced at the edge: interactive mode only allows one tool per non-infra role; one-shot uses single-value flags per role (`--infra` is repeatable). A `Selection` that exists is valid: there is no separate validation module.

### 3.4 Pipeline types (`scaffold/`)

```rust
pub struct TemplateContext { … }   // per-role flags + RoleContexts + contract constants
pub struct RoleContext { tool_id, tool_name, language, dir }
pub struct FilePlan { entries: Vec<FileEntry> }
pub struct FileEntry { dest: PathBuf, source: TemplateSource, render: bool }
pub enum TemplateSource { Base(String), Role(String), Optional(String), Inline(Vec<u8>) }
```

`TemplateContext` is `Serialize` and is the entire surface templates can see. It carries `has_*` booleans per role, an `Option<RoleContext>` per single-tool role, `infra_tools: Vec<RoleContext>`, the contract constants (`blueprint_path`, `env_vars`), and Nix info. `render` is derived from the `.jinja` extension.

---

## 4. Interface contract (`contract.rs`)

The contract is a set of constants every template conforms to. It is the seam that makes composition generic.

```rust
pub const BLUEPRINT_PATH: &str = "blueprint/plutus.json";
pub const DIR_ON_CHAIN = "on-chain"; DIR_OFF_CHAIN = "off-chain";
pub const DIR_INFRA = "infra"; DIR_TESTING = "test"; DIR_FORMAL_METHODS = "formal-methods";
pub const ENV_INDEXER_URL = "INDEXER_URL"; ENV_INDEXER_PORT = "INDEXER_PORT";
pub const ENV_NODE_SOCKET_PATH = "NODE_SOCKET_PATH"; ENV_NETWORK = "CARDANO_NETWORK";
```

**Compliance checklist (enforced mechanically by contract-compliance tests):**

- **Every template** ships a `Justfile` exposing `build`, `test`, `dev`, `clean`, and works **independently** (its `just build` succeeds with no other roles present). A target that is a no-op for that tool must still exist (printing a message is fine).
- **On-chain** produces the CIP-57 blueprint at `../blueprint/plutus.json` during `build`. Other roles read it from that path if present.
- **Infrastructure** writes standard connection vars to `../.env` during `dev`.
- **Off-chain / testing / formal-methods** read the blueprint and `.env` if present, and degrade gracefully when absent.

The `blueprint/` **directory** is scaffolded whenever any blueprint-producing-or-consuming
role is present, every project except infrastructure-only (§6.2), so the canonical
path exists wherever it's meaningful; the `plutus.json` **file** within it may still be
absent (no on-chain role, or no build yet), which is why consumers must tolerate its
absence. The CLI never tracks which tools produce/consume blueprints: it is a
template-level convention verified by tests, not registry metadata.

---

## 5. Registry

Each tool is one TOML file under `registry/tools/`:

```toml
[tool]
id = "aiken"
name = "Aiken"
description = "…newcomer-friendly explanation…"
website = "https://aiken-lang.org"
languages = ["aiken"]
system_deps = ["aiken"]    # abstract dep ids → resolved via registry/deps.toml (§8)
nix_packages = ["aiken"]       # packages for the generated Nix dev shell

[roles.on-chain]
template = "aiken/on-chain"    # path under templates/
```

`loader.rs` iterates embedded assets, parses each TOML into a `ToolDef`, and builds a `Registry` with two indexes: `by_id` (lookup) and `by_role` (list tools for a role). Loading rejects duplicate ids and an empty registry. The registry is immutable after load.

---

## 6. Scaffolding pipeline

Four independent, individually testable phases. `--dry-run` stops after phase 2.

```

        ▼
┌────────────────┐   ┌──────────────┐   ┌──────────────┐   ┌───────────────┐

└────────────────┘   └──────────────┘   └──────────────┘   └───────────────┘
                         │
                    --dry-run exits here (returns FilePlan)
```

### 6.1 Context (`context.rs`)

Walks `selection.assignments`, resolves each tool against the registry, and builds the `TemplateContext`: per-role `has_*` flags and `RoleContext`s, deduplicated `nix_packages`, contract constants, and `.env` variable seeds. Errors on unknown tool or role mismatch.

### 6.2 Plan (`planner.rs`)

Produces the ordered `FilePlan`:
1. **Base layer** (always): `Justfile`, `README.md`, `.gitignore`, `.env`.
2. **Blueprint dir**: `blueprint/.gitkeep`, emitted whenever the selection includes any blueprint-producing-or-consuming role: i.e., any role **except** infrastructure (equivalently: present unless the project is infrastructure-only).
3. **Role layers**: for each assignment, read the template's `manifest.toml` and add its files. Infrastructure tools each nest under `infra/<tool_id>/`.
4. **Optional layer**: `flake.nix` + `.envrc` when `nix` is set.

No I/O: only embedded assets are read. `render` is set from the `.jinja` extension.

The `blueprint/` directory gives every blueprint-consuming role (off-chain, testing, formal-methods) a stable, predictable path to read from, and lets a user drop a hand-supplied or externally-built `plutus.json` into the same place even when on-chain isn't scaffolded in this project. It is omitted only for infrastructure-only projects, where no role produces or consumes a blueprint. Only the directory (via `.gitkeep`) is created; the `plutus.json` *file* is produced by on-chain `build`, so consumers must still handle its absence gracefully (§4).

> **Code note:** the current `planner.rs` creates `blueprint/.gitkeep` only when on-chain is present (guarded by a `has_on_chain` check). The rule above broadens that guard to "any non-infrastructure role present".

### 6.3 Render (`renderer.rs`) & Write (`writer.rs`)

Render processes each entry whose source is a `.jinja` template through MiniJinja with the `TemplateContext`. Render-ness is **derived from the file extension** at plan time: the planner sets `FileEntry.render = source.ends_with(".jinja")` (§6.2); it is not an authored manifest field (manifests list only `source`/`dest`). Non-`.jinja` files, and `Inline` sources, pass through verbatim. Write is the **only** phase that touches disk: it creates parent directories and writes each file's content.

### 6.4 Determinism rule

**Determinism is a guarantee of the planning phase.** The planner emits entries in a fixed order: base layer → blueprint dir (when any non-infrastructure role is present) → role layers in **`Role::ALL` order** → optional layer. Within Infrastructure (the only multi-tool role), tools are ordered by **sorted tool id**. Any `HashMap` (e.g. `env_vars`) is iterated through a sorted/canonical view before it reaches output. Snapshot tests over `--dry-run` and rendered output enforce byte-stability. No other phase may introduce nondeterministic ordering.

> Current code stores `roles` in a `HashMap` and preserves `assignments` in flag order; formalizing the canonical ordering above (esp. sorting infra by id and iterating `assignments` in `Role::ALL` order) is the concrete work item this rule mandates.

---

## 7. CLI surfaces & output model

### 7.1 Modes

`cli/mod.rs` parses args with `clap`. There is an optional subcommand and a flattened set of init flags:

- **One-shot** (`--name` + role flags): flags → `Selection` in `oneshot.rs`, non-interactive, deterministic. Primary path for agents and CI.
- **Interactive** (no `--name`): guided `dialoguer` flow in `interactive.rs`.
- **`web` subcommand**: launches the local builder server (§10).
- **`list` subcommand** (planned): capability discovery; lists roles/tools, human by default, `--format json` for agents (see §7.3).

A safety check refuses to overwrite an existing target directory.

### 7.2 Output model: `--format` + presenter (planned)

Today output is human-styled text printed directly. To serve both humans and agents without scattering format branches, the architecture introduces:

- A global **`--format human|json`** flag (default `human`; `json` implies non-interactive: JSON mode never prompts).
- **`output.rs` as a presenter**: the pure core returns *structured results* and *typed errors*; only the presenter knows about colors, tables, or JSON. Adding a new output is a presenter change, nothing else.

### 7.3 Machine-readable errors & discovery (planned, PRD FR-13/FR-15)

- **Errors** carry a **stable string code** (e.g. `unknown_tool`, `tool_role_mismatch`, `name_required`, `dir_exists`) plus context (offending input + valid alternatives) and map to **meaningful exit codes**. In `--format json`, errors serialize to a stable shape on stderr; the core never falls back to interactive prompting in non-interactive mode. `CliError` already enumerates these cases; this work adds the code + serializable representation.
- **Discovery** is a dedicated **`list` subcommand** (`cardano-init list`) that emits the registry (roles, tools, the roles each fills, languages, deps). It defaults to human-readable output and accepts **`--format json`** for structured/agent consumption; both forms render from the same data. `web::build_registry_json` and `cli::build_tool_catalog` are the existing JSON/human renderers to converge here.

---

## 8. Dependency doctor (`doctor/`, planned)

Scope: **check + advise**, plus the standalone **`cardano-init doctor`** command, both targeted for DX.02. **Auto-install** (running the resolved plan with consent) is a later nice-to-have install command (DX.05); see ROADMAP. The dependency catalog is a small **graph**, split between code and data along the purity invariant:

```
doctor/
├── mod.rs         Pure: resolve(targets, catalog, env) -> Report   (recursive, cycle-safe)
├── installers.rs  Pure (code): the closed `Installer` vocabulary. Per installer: detect binaries, command template, and a `bootstrap` list of dep ids
├── catalog.rs     Loads embedded registry/deps.toml -> DepCatalog (dep id → recipe)
└── probe.rs       Impure: detect OS + which installers are on PATH -> Environment
```

- **Two-tier inputs.** The selection yields **required** deps = `{just}` (universal task runner) ∪ the `system_deps` of all selected tools (unioned, deduped); and **recommended** deps = `{process-compose}` **if  two or more infrastructure tools are selected** (improves multi-service `just dev`, never required; TECH_SPEC §7.2/§9.1). `just`/`process-compose` are base/derived deps owned by no tool. Missing recommended deps are soft notes, never blocking.
- **Installers vs deps: the key model.** An **installer** is just another dependency. Code owns a *closed* `Installer` vocabulary (`Brew`, `Apt`, `Dnf`, `Pacman`, `Winget`, `Nix`, `Go`, `Cargo`, `Npm`, `Aikup`, `CardanoUp`, `Curl`, `PowerShell`); each declares its detect-binaries, a command template (`brew install {arg}`, `npm install -g {arg}`, `curl -sSfL {arg} | sh`, …), and a **`bootstrap` list of dep ids**. An **empty `bootstrap` list ⇒ terminal** (we detect it, never install it: system package managers, `nix`, the OS shells); a **non-empty list ⇒ bootstrappable** by installing any one of those deps in order (`npm`→`["node"]`, `aikup`→`["aikup"]`, `cargo`→`["rustup","rust"]`). This is what makes the catalog a graph rather than a flat list.
- **Recipes live in data.** Per-dep recipes are an embedded TOML file (`registry/deps.toml`), keyed by dep id: `binaries` (presence check), `docs` (universal fallback), and an ordered `install` list of `{ installer = arg }` methods. Installer names are validated against the code enum at load (unknown installer → load error, like an unknown `Role`). See §8.1 for why code/data split this way.
- **Resolver (`resolve`, pure, recursive).** A dep is present if  any of its `binaries` is on `PATH`. For a missing dep, walk its `install` methods in order: the first method whose installer is **detected** yields a one-step command; otherwise, if the installer is **bootstrappable**, recurse to satisfy one of its `bootstrap` deps and prepend those steps. The result is an ordered, possibly multi-step **plan** (e.g. `aiken` missing with no `nix`/`aikup` → install `aikup` via `npm`, then `aikup install latest`). Picking a single method per dep is exactly why the `nix` path needs no `aikup`. Cycle detection guards the walk; `docs` is the fallback when nothing resolves (advice never empty, FR-20). Version constraints are out of scope for v1 (presence only); doctor output is **host-dependent by design** (not part of the byte-identical generation contract).
- **Infrastructure deps** install via `cardano-up` (the `CardanoUp` installer); `cardano-up` is itself a dep in `registry/deps.toml` (bootstrappable via its own installer methods). Auto-installing it arrives with the DX.05 install command; bootstrapping `cardano-up` when absent may follow post-RC (ROADMAP).
- **Boundary:** `mod.rs`/`installers.rs`/`catalog.rs` are pure and unit-tested with synthetic `Environment`s; only `probe.rs` touches the system. `doctor` depends on `registry`/`contract`, never on `cli`.

### 8.1 The code/data split

The catalog is a graph with two kinds of node, split by what each kind *is*:

- **Installers are code** (`installers.rs`). Detection, command templating, and the `bootstrap` edges are *logic*, and the set is a closed vocabulary, so it earns compile-time safety (installer references are un-typo-able; a removed installer fails to compile) and one tested home for platform quirks. Adding an installer is a deliberate code change, done only when a real recipe needs it on a supported platform.
- **Recipes are data** (`registry/deps.toml`). This is what honors the project's extensibility promise: a tool author adds a tool by writing `system_deps = [...]` and, if a dep is new, a `registry/deps.toml` entry that *chooses from* the existing installer vocabulary, with **no Rust**. Recipes are deduplicated by dep id (shared deps like `node`/`jvm` are defined once and referenced by many tools), and installer names are validated against the enum at load.

This split is the reversal of the earlier "in-code catalog" : the common case (a new tool whose deps install via existing installers) becomes pure data, which is the whole point of the registry model. The narrow case that still needs code (a brand-new installer) is rare and benefits from maintainer review anyway. Safety is preserved because data only ever names a closed, code-defined installer plus an `arg`; it never carries free-form command logic.

```toml
# registry/deps.toml: keyed by dep id; install = ordered [{ installer = arg }]
[node]
binaries = ["node"]
docs     = "https://nodejs.org/en/download"
install  = [ { brew = "node" }, { apt = "nodejs" }, { winget = "OpenJS.NodeJS" }, { nix = "nodejs" } ]

[aikup]
binaries = ["aikup"]
docs     = "https://aiken-lang.org/installation-instructions"
install  = [ { npm = "@aiken-lang/aikup" }, { curl = "https://install.aiken-lang.org" }, { powershell = "https://windows.aiken-lang.org" } ]

[aiken]
binaries = ["aiken"]
docs     = "https://aiken-lang.org/installation-instructions"
install  = [ { aikup = "latest" }, { nix = "aiken" } ]
```

**Referential integrity (tests):** every `system_deps` id (plus base deps `just` / `process-compose`) has a `registry/deps.toml` entry; every installer named in the data exists in the `Installer` enum; every dep id in an installer's `bootstrap` list exists. The full field-by-field schema and the resolver algorithm are in TECH_SPEC §9.

---

## 9. Version-update check (`cli/update.rs`, planned)

The chosen mechanism for template freshness without runtime template fetching (PRD A-3/FR-24). It is a **thin `cli/` concern** (UX, network, never core):

- Best-effort check against the GitHub releases API; the notice (if any) is surfaced **before the write phase**, so the user can update and regenerate rather than discovering it post-write. It informs, never gates (the user may Ctrl-C to update first); it never alters generated output.
- **Latency is hidden, not added.** In **interactive** mode the check fires async at startup and completes during tool selection: zero added latency. In **human one-shot** there's no think-time to hide it, so the result is joined with a **≤1s deadline** behind a spinner before writing (worst case +1s, once/day).
- **Cached once/day** (small file in the OS cache dir): already-checked-today → zero network, zero latency.
- **Gated and fail-silent**: only when stdout is a TTY and not `--format json` (agents/CI: no network, no spinner, no notice). Offline/timeout/parse error → no-op. Preserves offline operation and determinism (A-3).

---

## 10. Web UI architecture

The CLI is the **single source of truth**; the web UI never generates a project: it configures, previews structure, and emits a copyable `cardano-init …` command.

### 10.1 Local server (`web/`, exists)

A hand-rolled, zero-dependency HTTP/1.1 server (`TcpListener` + threads) chosen to keep the "single static binary, zero runtime deps" goal. Routes:
- `GET /` → embedded `ui.html`.
- `GET /api/registry` → registry as JSON (prebuilt once).
- `GET /api/plan?…` → runs the **actual Rust planner** and returns the file tree.

Because `/api/plan` calls `scaffold::planner`, the local server's preview is guaranteed to match real generation: no duplicated logic.

### 10.2 Hosted page

A hosted page has no binary behind it. The key observation: the **command string** is trivial to assemble in JS (concatenate flags) and needs *no* planner. Only the live *file-tree preview* needs planner logic. So the resolution is staged:

- **RC (DX.05): static builder.** Ship the registry as **static JSON** and assemble the `cardano-init …` command in plain JS. No binary, no planner, no drift on the command string. The planner-backed **live tree preview is dropped** for the RC (the command output is the deliverable). Hostable as a pure static site.
- **Post-RC: WASM live-preview.** Compile the pure registry+planner to WASM so the hosted builder shows the exact file tree with zero logic duplication (realizes the "future extraction" goal). Deferred to Phase 2 (ROADMAP): adds a WASM build/bindings workstream not worth the RC-deadline risk.

The local `serve` path (10.1) ships regardless and keeps its planner-backed preview. If a JS tree-preview approximation is ever added before WASM, it must be tested against the planner's output to bound drift.

---

## 11. Testing strategy

- **Unit (pure core):** registry loading (every TOML parses, fields present); context building; planning (exact file set + order); rendering (context + template → expected output); doctor `resolve` over synthetic environments (incl. multi-step bootstrap chains and the cycle guard).
- **Contract compliance (mechanical):** for each template, assert the Justfile exposes `build`/`test`/`dev`/`clean`; for on-chain, assert `just build` produces `blueprint/plutus.json`. This is what lets us avoid testing tool combinations.
- **Per-tool build smoke tests:** scaffold each tool in isolation and, where CI has the toolchain (or via Nix), run `just build && just test`. New tools must add these (PRD SM-1).
- **Scheduled maintenance gate:** the per-tool smoke tests also run on a schedule (weekly cron + manual dispatch, `.github/workflows/scheduled-smoke.yml`), not only on PR/commit. This is what detects a *generated project* breaking with **no repo change** — a Cardano hardfork, a breaking upstream tool release, or an unmaintained dependency (templates pin floating version ranges). A failure opens a tracking issue. It is distinct from the PR gates, which catch regressions we introduce.
- **Determinism / snapshot tests:** `--dry-run` and rendered output compared against committed snapshots for a set of selections; guards §6.4.
- **No combinatorial testing:** composition is guaranteed by the contract, so we verify each tool individually rather than every pair.

## 12. Extensibility: adding a tool

1. Add `registry/tools/<tool>.toml` with metadata, `system_deps`, `nix_packages`, and a `[roles.<role>]` block per supported role.
2. Add `templates/<tool>/<role>/` with a `manifest.toml` and template files (conforming to the contract, §4).
3. If the tool introduces a new `system_deps` id, add a `registry/deps.toml` entry (pure data; code is needed only if the dep requires a brand-new installer, §8).
4. Add the per-tool tests (§11).
5. Recompile (assets are embedded at compile time).

No CLI/core code changes are required for a new tool. Contract conformance guarantees it composes with every existing tool in other roles.
