# Quick start

## 1. Create a project

Run the command with no arguments to start the interactive setup. It asks for a project name and a tool for each role:

```bash
cardano-init
```

If you already know which tools you want, use **one-shot mode**. Passing `--name` makes the command run without any prompts:

```bash
cardano-init --name my-protocol --on-chain aiken --off-chain meshjs --devnet yaci
```

Select only the roles you need. One role is enough:

```bash
cardano-init --name my-validators --on-chain aiken
```

To see the tools available for each role:

```bash
cardano-init list          # detailed list
cardano-init list --table  # compact matrix
```

## 2. Check your dependencies

Each tool needs its own toolchain. Run the dependency doctor from inside the generated project:

```bash
cd my-protocol
cardano-init doctor
```

It finds the components in the project, checks which toolchains are installed, and prints the install command for each one that is missing.

## 3. Build and test

Every generated project uses [`just`](https://just.systems):

```bash
just build   # build every component (on-chain first, so the blueprint exists)
just test    # build, then run every component's tests
just clean   # remove build artifacts
```

`just test` passes on a new project, because every stack includes a worked gift-card example. Change the protocol as you need and run `just test` often.

## 4. Run a local chain (optional)

If you selected a devnet or an infrastructure provider, start it from its own component:

```bash
just -f devnet/Justfile dev   # for example, start Yaci DevKit
just -f infra/Justfile dev    # for example, start Kupo and Ogmios with cardano-up
```

Both write their connection details into the project's `.env`. The off-chain component reads them from there.

## More examples

```bash
# Show what would be generated, without writing anything
cardano-init --name my-protocol --on-chain aiken --dry-run

# Fullstack: one tool for both on-chain and off-chain, as a single protocol/ component
cardano-init --name my-protocol --fullstack scalus

# Short flags
cardano-init -n my-protocol -p scalus -d yaci

# Also generate a Nix flake for the project's dependencies
cardano-init --name my-protocol --on-chain aiken --off-chain meshjs --nix

# Later, from inside the project: add or replace a tool, or remove one
cardano-init add --on-chain plinth
cardano-init remove --devnet
```

The [Command reference](commands.md) lists every flag.
